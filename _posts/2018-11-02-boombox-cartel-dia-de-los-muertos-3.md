Halloween may have passed but, fear not, Boombox Cartel gets us again with their filthy Dia De Los Muertos Mix. Every year we look forward to getting another great mix of spooky songs and filthy bass. This year is no different. It suprises us with amazing edits, unreleased ear candy, and a ton of other hits. Don't miss it!
