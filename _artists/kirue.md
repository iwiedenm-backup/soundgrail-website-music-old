KIRUE takes the stage as a distinguished performer winning the hearts of electronic music lovers worldwide with captivating records and stunning live performances. The KIRUE experience is an orchestrated adventure where one can only expect a beautiful synthesis of an unlikely, genre-blending production filled with sounds that are as lush as they are distorted, as nostalgic as they are futuristic, and as determined as they are open-minded. KIRUE stops at nothing to deliver an interactive performance filled with impeccable sound design and dreamlike melodies that come to life as a true auditory, visual, and emotional experience.

LA Native and Icon Collective student Ian Wiedenman began producing music in 2016 as KIRUE and has since released many collaborations and singles including his remix of "Indestructible" by Not Your Dope released by Dim Mak Records in 2018.
